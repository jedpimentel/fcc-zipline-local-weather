A simple "local weather" app.

Created as pard of the freecodecamp.com curriculum
http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather

Temperature and wind speed can be shown in either metric or imperial.
Measurements default to metric, except for users in the US, Myanmar and Liberia.

Weather icon varies with weather conditions. I did not use a dynamic background image
as suggested, because I find them both distracting and as too much bloat. Most users
are used to their local terrain and weather conditions, and most dynamically pulled
images would feel either too cold or too hot, and with flora they aren't used to.

TO DO: after succesfully pulling user location, API request is made syncronously instead of async.
